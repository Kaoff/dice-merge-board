# Dice Merge Public Board
Welcome to Dice Merge Public Board !

Here is your space if you want to:
- Report bugs
- Request a feature
- Share ideas
- Send feedbacks about UI, etc.

## Rules
Please, note that there are few rules if you want to post anything here.

### Using labels
For every issue that you post, you should use the corresponding label

- Bug: If you encountered something that is not right in the game, and would like to share it, use this.
- Idea/Feature: If you got an idea, or would like to propose a new feature, this label is here.
- Feedback: If you want to make a feedback, positive or negative (but always constructive), that's the way.

### Basic politeness
A message that begins politely and ends politely will always be more welcomed than others. ;)

Don't forget to say hi, take the time to explain your point, and use emojis to thanks people.
